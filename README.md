### What I learned

n this project, there were no really new things to learn, but it was really useful to practice how to center elements in a divided the screen, and more.

It was genuinely interesting to practice the use of pseudo-elements to place the icon in the 'Add to Cart' button.

And of course, I practiced a bit of responsive web design.
